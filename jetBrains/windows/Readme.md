# Readme
Take into account, that key bindings assume that `ctr` and `alt` are swapped.

## Swap `alt` and `ctr`
1. Install AutoHotKey [from here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
2. Create file named swap-alt-ctrl.ahk
3. The file contains:
```
LCtrl::Alt
LAlt::Ctrl
```
4. Move the file to startup folder (to find this folder, open the Run prompt (Windows key + R) and type shell:startup)
